   ?React Fragements

  - What are the benefits of React fragment? 
     - With React Fragment, you can render multiple elements of a 
     component without adding extra div tags. We can write cleaner, 
     more readable code with React Fragments.
     - It takes up less memory and renders components faster.
     Each component is rendered as expected.

  - When should I use React fragments?
     - When should you use React Fragment.
     - You should use the React Fragment when you want to add 
     a parent element to fulfill the JSX syntax, but without 
     introducing an extra node to the DOM.
     - After compilation, the fragment component does not make it 
     to the DOMâ€”only the children element do.

// TODO : What are props (properties)?
/*
- React components use props to communicate with each other.
- Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.
- Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.

  ?Passing props to a component
     - Step 1: Pass props to the child component
     - Step 2: Read props inside the child component

*/

/*
   ! Props : Key features :
       - Props are used to pass data from parent components to Child Components (Down the Component tree).
       - Essential tool to configure and customize components (like function parameters).
       - with props ,parent components control how child components look and work.
       - Anything can be passed as props : Single Values , Arrays , Objects, functions, Even Other components.
       - ! Props are Read- Only!:

        * Important React Rule Why Props are Read Only ! Why They are immutable
          - Props is data coming from the outside , and can only be Updated by the Parent Component.
          - Hence Props are Read - Only ,they are immutable! This is one of React's Strict Rules.
          - If You need to mutate props,you actually need state.
          - So, Why ?
          - Mutating Props would affect Parent, creating side Effect(Not pure).
          - Components have to be pure functions in terms of props and state.
          - This allows React to Optimize apps, avoid bugs , Make apps predictable.
*/
/*

 !React Uses One Way Data Flow .
  - One Way Data Flow :
  - Makes applications More predictable and easier to understand.
  - makes applications easier to debug as we have more control over the data .
  - Is More Performant.
*/

//  !Default Props .
/* 
    - The defaultProps is a React component property that allows you to set default values for the props argument.
    - If the prop property is passed, it will be changed.
    - The defaultProps can be defined as a property on the component class itself,
        to set the default props for the class.
export default function Greeting({
  firstName,
  lastName,
  users,
 * fullName = "Yatin Chaudhari", --- > Default Props
}) 
  */

// !Children Props.
/*
   - Children is a prop (this.props.children) that allow you to pass components as data to other components, 
   just like any other prop you use. 
   - Component tree put between component's opening and closing tag will be passed to that component as children prop.
  
   - There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop. 
   - These include React.Children.map, React.Children.forEach, React.Children.count,
    React.Children.only, React.Children.toArray
